Cybersecurity projects and other online tinkering
Hi, my name is Anasazi Ingram. I am taking the Google Cybersecurity class through Coursera. I am putting all of my projects that I do through the course on there as well as any other projects I may start not in the course. Such as; networking, coding, and hacking. I have some small background knowledge within the tech field, but this is something I am seriously passionate about. If you have any inquiries, tips, tricks, or advice please feel free to reach out.
